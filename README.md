## 📊 Project Overview
This project compares the following three **classification models**:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**

The models are trained on an **online payment transaction dataset**. The primary goal is to determine which model performs best in terms of **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.

### 🔹 **Key Features:**
✅ **Preprocessing Steps**: Data cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering.  
✅ **Model Training**: Hyperparameter tuning for optimal results.  
✅ **Evaluation Metrics**: ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, precision-recall curves.  
✅ **Comparison & Insights**: Discussion on model strengths and weaknesses.
